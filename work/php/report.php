                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I knew about the techniques Git and GitHub. However, i did not know about Markdown and GitHub Pages. We have used Git and GitHub for our projects since the first year. However, I got lazy because Git was built into
                            the different frameworks and therefore I didn't need to use the commands. That is something I really appriciate this course, we are "forced" into the "Git enviroment". We have never had any course ON GitHub, it was actually
                            my first time forking another project and even though we have used Git, there were still some commands that I haven't used because the comfort of Git inside the frameworks.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you ever created websites before?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> No, I have not but I am very excited to learn! Since I started studying this programme I've gained a big interest in front-end. I really wish we had more courses in front-end.
                        </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I do not have any experiences in web application development. The knowledge about web application development is not that big either except for the HTTP protocol, but no knowledge in the different frameworks,
                                css and html. However, as I wrote in the last question, I am very excited to learn. </p>

                            <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I refreshed my memory regarding Git and the commands. I learned about markdown and gitpages, also experienced a new environment. I didn't encounter any problems, it was pretty straight-forward. The only problem
                                if there were any would probably only be me forgetting some Git commands, but that is not really a problem thought. They will surely come later in the course.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I have no experience of CSS or JavaScript. I did however do the codeacademy quick-course of HTML. That was a long while ago though and I can't say I remember that much. I am very interested in learning HTML, CSS
                            and JavaScript though since I've gained an interest in front-end development during my study.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic stucture of an webpage, it is at the core of every webpage. CSS is used for the formatting, presentation and the style, for example type of the font, color, size and layout. JavaScript is
                            used to control the behaviour of the elements. JavaScript is supported by all modern websites. Basically, HTML is the structure, CSS makes it look pretty and JavaScript make it </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting
                            web browser requests and server responses.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> This course section I learned how to create my own website for the reports we will write during this course. I also learned the basics for HTML and CSS. Lecture 2 and assignment 2 was really fun actually. </p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I have not previous experience of client side JavaScript. I have worked with some JavaScript before but that was also the codeacademy's "quick course". That was ony the basics however, like variables, functions,
                            conditionals etc. I have watched some youtube videos of JavaScript but that was a while ago as well, I dont remember much. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>The only programming language I know is Java. I actually thought Java and JavaScript was related because of the name, aaaand I was so wrong. They are not even remotly similar. Java and Javascript are similar like
                            Car and Carpet are similar.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I'm a bit embarresed to say that I actually aimed for the grade 3 for this assignment. That is only because I like styling so much that I ended up spending all my time styling instead of the assignments. My plan
                            was to do the grade 3 and spend rest of the time beautify my page. The code turned out OK, it could be better and I will probably change it later. For example, in my schools.html, I have the script in the html. I should/will
                            move it to a .js file. </p>
