                    <p> My name is Ella. I am a third year student at HKR university, studying computer science.</p>
                    <p>Before this programme, I had little to none experience or even knowledge regarding computer related stuff. I was a little computer nerd though, or video-games nerd rather.
                        <p>Not gonna lie, it hasn't always been easy. I am also a bit lazy.. that didn't help. No experience or knowledge AND lazy? Yep it was hard indeed. </p>
                        <p>I've really gained an interest in front-end during this programme, I like making things look pretty :D Since I've been more interested in front-end, it has been hard finding motivation to code outside of school because we've always
                            done backend stuff, but HTML and CSS is something that I enjoy doing when I am home.</p>
                        <p>I just think I've found "my thing" you know? It really feels like this is what Im supposed to do. </p>
