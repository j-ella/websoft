                        <h2>S01</h2>
                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I knew about the techniques Git and GitHub. However, i did not know about Markdown and GitHub Pages. We have used Git and GitHub for our projects since the first year. However, I got lazy because Git was built into
                            the different frameworks and therefore I didn't need to use the commands. That is something I really appriciate this course, we are "forced" into the "Git enviroment". We have never had any course ON GitHub, it was actually
                            my first time forking another project and even though we have used Git, there were still some commands that I haven't used because the comfort of Git inside the frameworks.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you ever created websites before?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> No, I have not but I am very excited to learn! Since I started studying this programme I've gained a big interest in front-end. I really wish we had more courses in front-end.
                        </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I do not have any experiences in web application development. The knowledge about web application development is not that big either except for the HTTP protocol, but no knowledge in the different frameworks,
                                css and html. However, as I wrote in the last question, I am very excited to learn. </p>

                            <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I refreshed my memory regarding Git and the commands. I learned about markdown and gitpages, also experienced a new environment. I didn't encounter any problems, it was pretty straight-forward. The only problem
                                if there were any would probably only be me forgetting some Git commands, but that is not really a problem thought. They will surely come later in the course.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I have no experience of CSS or JavaScript. I did however do the codeacademy quick-course of HTML. That was a long while ago though and I can't say I remember that much. I am very interested in learning HTML, CSS
                            and JavaScript though since I've gained an interest in front-end development during my study.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic stucture of an webpage, it is at the core of every webpage. CSS is used for the formatting, presentation and the style, for example type of the font, color, size and layout. JavaScript is
                            used to control the behaviour of the elements. JavaScript is supported by all modern websites. Basically, HTML is the structure, CSS makes it look pretty and JavaScript make it </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting
                            web browser requests and server responses.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> This course section I learned how to create my own website for the reports we will write during this course. I also learned the basics for HTML and CSS. Lecture 2 and assignment 2 was really fun actually. </p>

                        <h2>S03</h2>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I have not previous experience of client side JavaScript. I have worked with some JavaScript before but that was also the codeacademy's "quick course". That was ony the basics however, like variables, functions,
                            conditionals etc. I have watched some youtube videos of JavaScript but that was a while ago as well, I dont remember much. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>The only programming language I know is Java. I actually thought Java and JavaScript was related because of the name, aaaand I was so wrong. They are not even remotly similar. Java and Javascript are similar like
                            Car and Carpet are similar.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I'm a bit embarresed to say that I actually aimed for the grade 3 for this assignment. That is only because I like styling so much that I ended up spending all my time styling instead of the assignments. My plan
                            was to do the grade 3 and spend rest of the time beautify my page. The code turned out OK, it could be better and I will probably change it later. For example, in my schools.html, I have the script in the html. I should/will
                            move it to a .js file. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>This course section I learned how JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web-pages through event with callbacks and the document object model. I also gained knowledge in how to retrive data from
                            external REST API through the use of AJAX request.</p>

                        <h2>S04</h2>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I have no previous experience with Node, npm, Node express and EJS. I have heard about Node and npm but not Node express and EJS. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I actually do not have that big of an interest in backend, therefore working with these programming tools are not that fun. It is intersting to KNOW, because you cant have too much knowledge, but it was not that
                            interesting to work with. Even if I dont have that much of an interest in backend as I wrote, it is still useful to have this knowledge.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>My plan with these assignments are often that I just follow the assignments and do as much as time allows me. My priority right now is sadly the degree thesis. My "plan" is to do as much as I can, atleast grade 3
                            and if I've got any time over, I proceed with the higher levels. I think the most important thing right now is passing the cources and spend more time on the degree thesis since that is was I'm more stressed about.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>For this assignment I aimed for grade 3. The reason is, as I mentioned above, that I rather spend time on the thesis project and focusing on passing the remaining courses. It was not a difficult level, actually it
                            was pretty easy. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>This course section, I learned how to run JavaScript on my computer and access programs and packages offered through the packet manager npm. I also learned how I can add functions and classes in seperate moduls.
                            In addition to that, I gained knowledge in how to build an application and websever using Node.js and Express.js module.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>How do I feel about PHP... Well. It was quite easy to understand. Since we mostly modified parts of an HTML file, it made it easy to understand what the difference between a static and dynamic site/applicaion. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I can only compare PHP to java, since Java is the programming language we have been working with during this program. Differences between Java and PHP are: Java is a programming language whereas PHP is a scriping
                            language. Php is integrated and java is compiled. Java IS object oriented by default while PHP CAN offer obejct oriented as an option. Another big difference is that Java can be used for both server and client side whereas
                            PHP is used for server-side. We have worked with JavaScript but I dont know enough to compare it to PHP.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>As I mentioned in the last sections, I aim for grade 3 in order to spend more time on the degree thesis. I am as satisfied with my result as I can be. Sure, I could be more satisfied if I spent more time with the
                            higher levels.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>In this course section, I learned about the server side scriping language PHP and use it to rebuild our pages from HTML to PHP. I also learned how to connect to a SQL database through PHP PDO using prepared statements.
                            I also learned how to use the CRUD operations to the database using PHP and HTML forms. </p>

                        <h2>S06</h2>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>Before this program, I had little to no experience with programming. During the program, we have mostly only worked in Java. Websoft is the first course that is introducing us to other programming languages. Because
                            of this, I do not have enough knowledge to have an opinion on the popularity of programming language. I do though have some knowledge from a conference about a guy who predicts the future for TypeScript, React and JavaScript.
                            According to him, TypeScript, React.js and JavaScript will continue to be on top. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>My choice for selecting my future programming languages will be JavaScript since I’m more interested in working with web-development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will be my main programming languages and I also need to
                            learn react, angular, vue and other JavaScript frameworks. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I chose to compare JavaScript and Jquery. I sorted my search for worldwide searches and past 12 months. The interest over time was on average: JavaScript had 93 while JQuery had 38. The numbers represent the search
                            interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. 100 is peak popularity while 0 is not enough data for this term. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=javascript,jquery">Link for the google trends comparison.</a></p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I would recommend TypeScript. TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language. Typescrpt is bascially a subset of JavaScript, it contains all of its elements. I would sell TypeScript by explaining how it can
                            simplify the JavaScript code and how it makes it easier to read and debug. It makes it easier for the developer to read and understand the code, which is what all developers long for. Developers who have been using TypeScript
                            said this about TypeScript: It's a smart choice for modern web- or JavaScript-based application. TypeScript gives autocompletion, type checking and source documentation. </p>
