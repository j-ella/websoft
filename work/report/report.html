                <p> <b>Question:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> I knew about the techniques Git and GitHub. However, i did not know about Markdown and GitHub Pages.  
                    We have used Git and GitHub for our projects since the first year. However, I got lazy because Git was built into the different frameworks and therefore I didn't need to use the commands.
                    That is something I really appriciate this course, we are "forced" into the "Git enviroment". We have never had any course ON GitHub, it was actually my first time forking another project and even though we have used Git, 
                    there were still some commands that I haven't used because the comfort of Git inside the frameworks.</p>
                
                <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you ever created websites before?</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> No, I have not but I am very excited to learn! Since I started studying this programme I've gained a big interest in front-end. I really wish we had more courses in front-end. 
                    </p>
                
                <p> <b>Question:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.    
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> I do not have any experiences in web application development. The knowledge about web application development is not that big either except for the HTTP protocol, but no knowledge in the different frameworks, css and html. However, as I wrote in the last question, I am very excited to learn. </p> 
                    
                <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> I refreshed my memory regarding Git and the commands. I learned about markdown and gitpages, also experienced a new environment. I didn't encounter any problems, it was pretty straight-forward. The only problem if there were any would probably only be me forgetting some Git commands, but that is not really a problem thought. They will surely come later in the course.</p>

                <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> I have no experience of CSS or JavaScript. I did however do the codeacademy quick-course of HTML. That was a long while ago though and I can't say I remember that much. I am very interested in learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript though since I've gained an interest in front-end development during my study.</p>
                
                <p> <b>Question:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic stucture of an webpage, it is at the core of every webpage. CSS is used for the formatting, presentation and the style, for example type of the font, color, size and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behaviour of the elements. JavaScript is supported by all modern websites. 
                    Basically, HTML is the structure, CSS makes it look pretty and JavaScript make it </p> 
                
                <p> <b>Question:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting web browser requests and server responses.</p>
                
                <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                
                <p> <b>Answer:</b> This course section I learned how to create my own website for the reports we will write during this course. I also learned 
                    the basics for HTML and CSS. Lecture 2 and assignment 2 was really fun actually. </p>
