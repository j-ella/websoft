                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I knew about the techniques Git and GitHub. However, i did not know about Markdown and GitHub Pages. We have used Git and GitHub for our projects since the first year. However, I got lazy because Git was built into
                            the different frameworks and therefore I didn't need to use the commands. That is something I really appriciate this course, we are "forced" into the "Git enviroment". We have never had any course ON GitHub, it was actually
                            my first time forking another project and even though we have used Git, there were still some commands that I haven't used because the comfort of Git inside the frameworks.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you ever created websites before?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> No, I have not but I am very excited to learn! Since I started studying this programme I've gained a big interest in front-end. I really wish we had more courses in front-end.
                        </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I do not have any experiences in web application development. The knowledge about web application development is not that big either except for the HTTP protocol, but no knowledge in the different frameworks,
                                css and html. However, as I wrote in the last question, I am very excited to learn. </p>

                            <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                            <p> <b>Answer:</b> I refreshed my memory regarding Git and the commands. I learned about markdown and gitpages, also experienced a new environment. I didn't encounter any problems, it was pretty straight-forward. The only problem
                                if there were any would probably only be me forgetting some Git commands, but that is not really a problem thought. They will surely come later in the course.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> I have no experience of CSS or JavaScript. I did however do the codeacademy quick-course of HTML. That was a long while ago though and I can't say I remember that much. I am very interested in learning HTML, CSS
                            and JavaScript though since I've gained an interest in front-end development during my study.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> HTML provides the basic stucture of an webpage, it is at the core of every webpage. CSS is used for the formatting, presentation and the style, for example type of the font, color, size and layout. JavaScript is
                            used to control the behaviour of the elements. JavaScript is supported by all modern websites. Basically, HTML is the structure, CSS makes it look pretty and JavaScript make it </p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> Web browsers and web servers function together as a client-server system. Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting
                            web browser requests and server responses.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question:</b> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

                        <p> <b>Answer:</b> This course section I learned how to create my own website for the reports we will write during this course. I also learned the basics for HTML and CSS. Lecture 2 and assignment 2 was really fun actually. </p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I have not previous experience of client side JavaScript. I have worked with some JavaScript before but that was also the codeacademy's "quick course". That was ony the basics however, like variables, functions,
                            conditionals etc. I have watched some youtube videos of JavaScript but that was a while ago as well, I dont remember much. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>The only programming language I know is Java. I actually thought Java and JavaScript was related because of the name, aaaand I was so wrong. They are not even remotly similar. Java and Javascript are similar like
                            Car and Carpet are similar.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I'm a bit embarresed to say that I actually aimed for the grade 3 for this assignment. That is only because I like styling so much that I ended up spending all my time styling instead of the assignments. My plan
                            was to do the grade 3 and spend rest of the time beautify my page. The code turned out OK, it could be better and I will probably change it later. For example, in my schools.html, I have the script in the html. I should/will
                            move it to a .js file. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>This course section I learned how JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web-pages through event with callbacks and the document object model. I also gained knowledge in how to retrive data from
                            external REST API through the use of AJAX request.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I have no previous experience with Node, npm, Node express and EJS. I have heard about Node and npm but not Node express and EJS. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I actually do not have that big of an interest in backend, therefore working with these programming tools are not that fun. It is intersting to KNOW, because you cant have too much knowledge, but it was not that
                            interesting to work with. Even if I dont have that much of an interest in backend as I wrote, it is still useful to have this knowledge.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>My plan with these assignments are often that I just follow the assignments and do as much as time allows me. My priority right now is sadly the degree thesis. My "plan" is to do as much as I can, atleast grade 3
                            and if I've got any time over, I proceed with the higher levels. I think the most important thing right now is passing the cources and spend more time on the degree thesis since that is was I'm more stressed about.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>For this assignment I aimed for grade 3. The reason is, as I mentioned above, that I rather spend time on the thesis project and focusing on passing the remaining courses. It was not a difficult level, actually it
                            was pretty easy. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>This course section, I learned how to run JavaScript on my computer and access programs and packages offered through the packet manager npm. I also learned how I can add functions and classes in seperate moduls.
                            In addition to that, I gained knowledge in how to build an application and websever using Node.js and Express.js module.</p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>How do I feel about PHP... Well. It was quite easy to understand. Since we mostly modified parts of an HTML file, it made it easy to understand what the difference between a static and dynamic site/applicaion. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I can only compare PHP to java, since Java is the programming language we have been working with during this program. Differences between Java and PHP are: Java is a programming language whereas PHP is a scriping
                            language. Php is integrated and java is compiled. Java IS object oriented by default while PHP CAN offer obejct oriented as an option. Another big difference is that Java can be used for both server and client side whereas
                            PHP is used for server-side. We have worked with JavaScript but I dont know enough to compare it to PHP.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>As I mentioned in the last sections, I aim for grade 3 in order to spend more time on the degree thesis. I am as satisfied with my result as I can be. Sure, I could be more satisfied if I spent more time with the
                            higher levels.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>In this course section, I learned about the server side scriping language PHP and use it to rebuild our pages from HTML to PHP. I also learned how to connect to a SQL database through PHP PDO using prepared statements.
                            I also learned how to use the CRUD operations to the database using PHP and HTML forms. </p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>Before this program, I had little to no experience with programming. During the program, we have mostly only worked in Java. Websoft is the first course that is introducing us to other programming languages. Because
                            of this, I do not have enough knowledge to have an opinion on the popularity of programming language. I do though have some knowledge from a conference about a guy who predicts the future for TypeScript, React and JavaScript.
                            According to him, TypeScript, React.js and JavaScript will continue to be on top. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>My choice for selecting my future programming languages will be JavaScript since I’m more interested in working with web-development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will be my main programming languages and I also need to
                            learn react, angular, vue and other JavaScript frameworks. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I chose to compare JavaScript and Jquery. I sorted my search for worldwide searches and past 12 months. The interest over time was on average: JavaScript had 93 while JQuery had 38. The numbers represent the search
                            interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. 100 is peak popularity while 0 is not enough data for this term. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=javascript,jquery">Link for the google trends comparison.</a></p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>I would recommend TypeScript. TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language. Typescrpt is bascially a subset of JavaScript, it contains all of its elements. I would sell TypeScript by explaining how it can
                            simplify the JavaScript code and how it makes it easier to read and debug. It makes it easier for the developer to read and understand the code, which is what all developers long for. Developers who have been using TypeScript
                            said this about TypeScript: It's a smart choice for modern web- or JavaScript-based application. TypeScript gives autocompletion, type checking and source documentation. </p>

                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>.NET is a cross platform and open source developer platform created by Microsoft, for building different types of applications. As a developer, you can choose to write in C#, F# or Visual Basic. With .NET, you can
                            use multiple editors and libraries to build web, mobile, desktop, gaming and IoT applications.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>Both Node.js and .NET are related to web development but they are completely different. Node.js itself allows you to create a web server but you still need frameworks sch as Express and libaries in order to develop
                            a web application. While .NET handles all of this for you. It creates routing through MVC, database connections etc. For me, .NET was a bit overwhelming, there was a lot of files generated that I was unsure about what they
                            do. I don't have any experience with C# either which makes it harder for me to understand. </p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>As usual, I aimed for grade 3. We have a lot of assignments due at the momement. These assignments, project, exam and thesis. Im a bit overwhelmed at the moment and Im focusing more on getting through the course
                            instead of getting the highest grade.</p>
                        <p> <b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p> <b>Answer: </b>This section, I've learned what MVC is and what its purpose is. I've gained more knowledge about ASP.NET framework, the .NET core environment and a bit regarding C#. Im still confused however, I will need to go through
                            it more in order to have a better understanding. It was pretty overwhelming. I've learned how to create a basic console application and web application. </p>

                        <p>For this assignment, a set of tools should be used in order to evaluate the performance of a few websites. We are a group of 3, consisting of Ella Jensen, Johan Granberg and Rasmus Olsson.</p>
                        <p> <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LX_dsJtw_f7RHTDO-FEdnFh1_lMa9TXuE_zeI9GH6M/edit?usp=sharing">Link to data sheet</a></b></p>
                        <p><b>1. Reddit (Rasmus)</b> </p>
                        <p>Reddit is a website I use everyday for a wide variety of reasons. I would describe it as a modern looking forum where you subscribe to a topic/genre eg. /r/soccer if i'm interested in soccer. I have always viewed the site to be
                            a little slow but not at all problematic so measuring it to see if it actually is slow compared to real metrics could be interesting. </p>
                        <p>The measured performance turned out to be worse than I expected and some parts of the tests showed unreasonable results although that could be faulted by my understanding of the metric. Lighthouse and Pagespeed showed a similar
                            general performance score of 20 and 26 but quite different results when it gets specific. Lighthouse showed a Time to interact of 28.8 seconds while Pagespeed showed a time of 11.1 seconds. None of the results feels representative
                            of how it actually feels using the website. I would say it feels like 2-3 seconds when using it and i thought that was really slow so there might be some kind of issue when using these tools for this particular metric. Overall
                            Pagespeed gave way faster results compared to Lighthouse yet gave it a similar general score. Using the network tab i could see that it's a quite heavy site compared to the other 2 sites we analysed with up to 5 times the amount
                            of resources received measured in MB. This is probably the result of the many images that are being loaded on reddit and this is probably also the reason the site takes 24.13 seconds to finish loading the page. </p>
                        <p>To speed up the page it's recommended to properly size the images which would lead to less data usage. It is also recommended to minimize main thread work but it's unclear on just how that would be done. Web Performance will always
                            be an important part of web development and it’s something to take seriously. Web pages today are expected to be fast these days and having a slow and unresponsive experience can have a serious impact on the user base.</p>

                        <p>I chose the website www.hltv.org. The reason being since it's a website I often use, I would say daily. </p>
                        <p>I’ve noticed it can be a bit slow sometimes and It could be interesting to evaluate the performance of a website I often visit. We could say that www.hltv.org could definitely improve their performance. However, it is a bit confusing
                            since the PageSpeed Insights score is 98 whereas the Lighthouse speed is 35. I made sure that the tests were on desktop and I tested it in regular-mode and incognito-mode, still the same results. The speed index on Lighthouse
                            was 6.8s whereas the speed index on PageSpeed Insights was 1.5s. It is a bit confusing since I don’t know which one is “correct”. Time to interact was also off. On PageSpeed Insights it was 1.7s and on Lighthouse it was 9.0s.
                            Regarding the network tabs findings, the requests was 102 which compared to the other two websites, was the lowest. The resources were only 4.6 MB as well which, compared to the other websites, were the lowest. </p>
                        <p> In order to load the page faster, they could properly size their images in order to save cellular data and this will improve the load time. They could also eliminate render-blocking resources. </p>
                        <p>Web testing is important in order to check your webpage for potential bugs before its made live and is accessible to the public. When testing performance, you test the webpages response times at different connection speeds, stress
                            test your website to determine its break point, test if a crash occurs due to peak load and also test the optimization for the browser and server side cache to reduce load times and compressions.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>3. Stronger (Johan)</b></p>
                        <p>I decided to inspect the webpage www.stronger.se because a friend of mine is working with the design of that page. </p>
                        <p>The overall Performance score was surprisingly low, only 14 when i did an inspection with Lighthouse and only 10 for the Pagespeed Insights check.</p>
                        <p>But it received 72 in score for Accessibility, 83 in score for SEO and 79 in score for Best Practices for the Lighthouse audit. Because the other scores were so high, I was surprised the overall score was so low. There are more
                            inconsistencies from these tests that confuses me, speed index for lighthouse was 7.8 and speed index from the Pagespeed Insight check was 11.4. It makes me question how accurate these “scores” are.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, the tips on how to improve the website so the “score” would be higher is interesting. I do question if it is actually needed. The website has a score of 79 for best practices. I would assume that there would be some improvement
                            if the score was 100. But how much difference would it make? One of the improvement tips was to add an alternate text to buttons. As I am quite new to web development I don't know how much this would improve the website overall
                            Performance score, but I don’t think it would matter that much.
                        </p>
                        <p>The tips that Lighthouse gives about images I understand and they sound like good advice. But I don’t know if it is applicable to this website, because I think they use the bigger file format to show their product in the best way.
                        </p>
                        <p>Web Performance especially for a website with an online store and with products such as fashion clothes, need to have a good looking website with good pictures but still be responsive and perform as good as possible. It may not
                            look like this webpage would perform that good but to me it feels like it is quite responsive. I have not however tried ordering clothes and using the actual webshop.

                        <p><b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b> This section, I've learned how to use three different tools in order to evaluate the performance on a website. I've learned which metrics to analyse and which metrics that are important.
                            I've also learned WHY its important to check and analyze web performance.</p>

                        <p><b>Question: </b>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
                        <p><b>Answer: </b>I think one of the most common security concerns are "Sensitive data exposure" and its also one concern of mine. I wouldn't want my data to be exposed for everyone to access. Attackers may steal or use the data in
                            order to perform credit card fraud and identity theft. It hasn't happend to me, yet. Sensitive data exposure is on the OWASP top 10 which is used for developers in order to minimize the risks.</p>
                        <p>Another concern of mine is broken authentication. If the application functions related to authentication is incorrectly implemented, attackers can gain access to the password, session tokens etc. I wouldn't want my account to be
                            hijacked since the account may contain messages, images, memories etc I woulnd't want to lose. The attackers can also post and use the accounts and pretend to be "me". </p>
                        <p>Another concern is injection which can lead to dataloss, corruption, denial of access. Attackers can also take complete control over the application due to injection. Imagine a business gets attacked and an injection is made on
                            the database, this will affect all the users/customers as well. This is one of the most known security issues on OWASP.</p>
                        <p><b>Question: </b>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
                        <p><b>Answer: </b>Guidelines to create secure web applications:</p>
                        <p>1. Keep yourself updated and follow web applications security techniques. </p>
                        <p>The best way to stay safe against hacker is to be aware of popular and new insecurities.</p>
                        <p>2. Always have a back-up for your data. </p>
                        <p>If you've got a security breach and you need to restore your data, it would be catastrophic if you havent backed up your data and you need to start all over again. </p>
                        <p>3. Ask professionals to "hack your web application".</p>
                        <p>4. Scan your website often for vulnerablities</p>
                        <p>5. Use a web application security platforms</p>
                        <p>6. Strong password policy and encryption for login</p>
                        <p><b>Question: </b>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
                        <p><b>Answer: </b>This course section, I've learned about the common security risks in a web application, how the attackers are using them and how to prevent it. I've also learned about OWASP top 10 security risks.</p>

                        <h2>S10</h2>
                       <p><b>*: </b>Our project was a showcase - art gallery for a small business that sells pipes. We worked according to their wishes. We had a menu/navigation with a front-page, about us(only for our purpose), login for administration, contact us and an admin page. 
                       </p>
                       <p>The way we implemented our project was by using node.js as our server-side techniques. For our web application framework we used express and for our backend we used a REST API. As for our connection to a relational database, we used MySql and php and javascript as our server scripting language. For the front-end part, HTML, CSS and JS were used. 
                    </p>
                    <p>There were no major problems during this project, it was pretty straight-forward. Of course, there were still some issues but that got resolved quickly. The project took some time, especially since we have other studies to do in the meanwhile, such as assignments, exams and thesis which resulted in some stress but I wasn’t worried about not finishing in time. For my part, the thing that was a bit tricky was image gallery and sometimes CSS is just weird. Centering stuff is much more complicated than it should be… Other than that, it was pretty straight-forward as I wrote earlier. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This was a good and reasonable project for this course for sure. Since this course is for development towards the web, I think it's important to have a project where you as a student get the opportunity to create our own website from scratch. I have nothing bad to say about working as a team for this project, it went great. Communication is on top and everyone in the group did what they felt like doing. 
                    </p>
                       <p><b>*: </b>I'm satisfied with this course, since I am interested in the front-end, I wish we had more courses like this. The content of the course was very useful. We have previously experienced outdated techniques during some courses and I think that this course gave us much more updated information about what is used and what is not being used etc. 
                       </p>
                       <p>he study guide and planning was another thing that I really appreciated. I also appreciated that everything was on GitHub, something that we haven’t had before. As I’ve written in my report, we have worked with Git many times, but we have never had any course materials on GitHub and being “forced” to always work with Git and Github. 
                    </p>
                       <p><b>*: </b>As for feedback, I would say that we had too many assignments. However, it may be my fault for not prioritizing enough, but I felt a bit overwhelmed since there were so many assignments, added with a project and exam. Because we also have a thesis at the moment, I think everyone is a bit “stressed”. However, I really liked that I as a student got to choose myself which grade I could aim for. This made me less stressed since I did what I needed for a pass, in order to have more time with the other assignments and studies. So for my suggestions for improvement, I would say maybe fewer assignments. Overall, I am satisfied with the course and I would recommend it to my friends. I wish we had more web-related courses. On a scale from 1-10, I would grade this course a 8. The teacher, materials, study guide, planning was great. I also appreciated that the lectures were recorded and uploaded, that is something we haven’t gotten during our courses. 
                       </p>
                       <p>My final TIL this course was learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, how to use JavaScript with AJAX and making our website dynamic. I’ve learned about the server-side JavaScript with the techniques Node and Express EJS and how to build applications using these techniques. I’ve learned how to use PHP in order to do CRUD on a database. I’ve learned about the MVC and ASP.NET and building application using C# together with ASP.NET. Lastly I’ve learned how to analyze the performance of websites, which tools to use and what to analyze and different security concerns and OWASP. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Thanks for a good course! </b></p>
